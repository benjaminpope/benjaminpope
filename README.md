### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ben
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [email](b.pope@uq.edu.au) or Twitter [@fringetracker](https://twitter.com/fringetracker)

I'm a Lecturer in Astrophysics and DECRA Fellow at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/).

I research extrasolar planets - planets around other stars - and focus on developing and applying new data science approaches for detecting and characterizing them.

Currently, I'm working on exoplanet direct imaging with JWST Aperture Masking Interferometry; a survey of naked-eye stars in Kepler, K2, and TESS, to search for transiting planets. I'm also interested in using radio astronomy to study planets' magnetic interactions with their host stars, and modelling radiocarbon in tree rings as a tracer of ancient solar activity.

Slides for my talks are available [here](https://benjaminpope.github.io/talks).

## some repos 

I've contributed to a number of open-source packages for physics, such as 

- [dLux](https://github.com/LouisDesdoigts/dLux), a Jax & [equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox/) library for differentiable, GPU accelerated physical optics
	- docs [here](https://louisdesdoigts.github.io/dLux)!
	- papers at [arXiv:2011.09780](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09780) and [arXiv:2107.00952](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00952)
	- dLux is a full rewrite of [morphine](https://github.com/benjaminpope/morphine), a physical optics simulation library forked from [poppy](https://github.com/mperrin/poppy) using [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) for autodiff
- [ticktack](https://github.com/SharmaLlama/ticktack/), a carbon box modelling library for analysing tree ring radiocarbon data
    - docs [here](https://sharmallama.github.io/ticktack/)
- [halophot](https://github.com/hvidy/halophot), a pipeline for extracting precise photometry from even very saturated K2 and TESS data
    - papers at [arXiv:1708.07462](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07462) and [arXiv:1908.06981](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06981)
- [keplersmear](https://github.com/benjaminpope/keplersmear), a pipeline for Kepler and K2 using collateral 'smear' data to recover missing lightcurves of bright stars
    - papers at [arXiv:1510.00008](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00008) and [arXiv:1905.09831](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09831)
- [k2sc](https://github.com/OxES/k2sc), a pipeline for calibrating K2 photometry using Gaussian Processes
    - paper at [arXiv:1603.09167](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09167)
    - docs [here](https://oxes.github.io/k2sc/)

## about me

I'm from Sydney, and did my undergrad at the University of Sydney. I completed my doctorate in 2017 at Oxford, and from 2017-20 was a NASA Sagan Fellow at the NYU Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics and Center for Data Science.
