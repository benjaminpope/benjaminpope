### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ben

I'm a Lecturer in Astrophysics and DECRA Fellow at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/).

I research extrasolar planets - planets around other stars - and focus on developing and applying new data science approaches for detecting and characterizing them.

Currently, I'm working on a survey of naked-eye stars in Kepler, K2, and TESS, to search for transiting planets. I'm also interested in exoplanet direct imaging, as well as using radio astronomy to study planets' magnetic interactions with their host stars.

Slides for my talks are available [here](https://benjaminpope.github.io/talks).

## some repos 

I've contributed to a number of open-source packages for physics, such as 

- [morphine](https://github.com/benjaminpope/morphine), a physical optics simulation library forked from [poppy](https://github.com/mperrin/poppy) using [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) for audodiff
	- docs [here](https://benjaminpope.github.io/morphine/)!
	- papers at [arXiv:2011.09780](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09780) and [arXiv:2107.00952](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00952)
- [halophot](https://github.com/hvidy/halophot), a pipeline for extracting precise photometry from even very saturated K2 and TESS data
    - papers at [arXiv:1708.07462](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07462) and [arXiv:1908.06981](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06981)
- [keplersmear](https://github.com/benjaminpope/keplersmear), a pipeline for Kepler and K2 using collateral 'smear' data to recover missing lightcurves of bright stars
    - papers at [arXiv:1510.00008](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00008) and [arXiv:1905.09831](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09831)
- [k2sc](https://github.com/OxES/k2sc), a pipeline for calibrating K2 photometry using Gaussian Processes
    - paper at [arXiv:1603.09167](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09167)
- [ticktack](https://github.com/SharmaLlama/ticktack/), a carbon box modelling library for analysing tree ring radiocarbon data
    - docs [here](https://sharmallama.github.io/ticktack/)
- [inclinations](https://github.com/benjaminpope/inclinations), a simple tool using Stan to infer rotational inclinations from rotational period and projected velocity

## about me

I'm from Sydney, and did my undergrad at the University of Sydney. I completed my doctorate in 2017 at Oxford, and from 2017-20 was a NASA Sagan Fellow at the NYU Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics and Center for Data Science.
