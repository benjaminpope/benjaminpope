### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ben

I'm a Lecturer in Astrophysics and DECRA Fellow at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/).

I research extrasolar planets - planets around other stars - and focus on developing and applying new data science approaches for detecting and characterizing them.

Currently, I'm working on a survey of naked-eye stars in Kepler, K2, and TESS, to search for transiting planets. I'm also interested in exoplanet direct imaging, as well as using radio astronomy to study planets' magnetic interactions with their host stars.

Slides for my talks are available [here](https://benjaminpope.github.io/talks).

## some repos of interest

I've contributed to a number of open-source packages for physics, such as 

- [morphine](https://github.com/benjaminpope/morphine), a physical optics simulation library forked from [poppy](https://github.com/mperrin/poppy) using [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) for audodiff
	- see docs [here](https://benjaminpope.github.io/morphine/)!

## about me

I'm from Sydney, and did my undergrad at the University of Sydney. I completed my doctorate in 2017 at Oxford, and from 2017-20 was a NASA Sagan Fellow at the NYU Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics and Center for Data Science.
